        <p style="margin:15px">JavaScript Basics</p>
        <p style="margin:15px">Javascript is a cross-platform,
             object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.
              It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
               Javascript lives inside a host environment(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments 
               to provide programmtic control over them.</p>
               <ul>
                   <li style="margin:15px"><u>Variable Decleration</u>Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifers.var x;</li>
                   <li style="margin:15px"><u>Variable Assignmen</u>Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;</li>
                   <li style="margin:15px"><u>Data Types</u>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null -null aka nothing; Number-42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</li>
                   <li style="margin:15px"><u>Conditionals</u>When you write code, you want to perform different actiosn for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</li>
                   <li style="margin:15px"><u>Loops </u>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repear an action some number of times. imagine you have to run a mile. well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                   <li style="margin:15px"><u>Function</u> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we ar putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
